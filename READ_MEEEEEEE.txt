PROJECT Made by Christopher Sebastian Hadeli 

Unfortunately school assignments have been a real weight lately. So as much as i love making a new project i have no choice but to continue the old one. 
I've made some drastic updates to the program however and of course added the new theme "SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE"

Not much to say this time around really, for a more in-depth explanation on what i added to this new version of the program, type in 'update' in the main menu command, enjoy!

______________________OLD NOTE (FOR ROUND 1)______________________
PROJECT Made by Christopher Sebastian Hadeli 

This project was made in a REPL and i tried adding as much as feature as i could without breaking the existing one.
Overall this project was fun to make and took me about a month to make, the coding process and polishing.
I definitely tried being creative with this project and every single line of code is written by me.

Of course the ASCII artists and testers have been credited respectively on the credits section.

I'm happy with the final result of this project and i hope everyone else does too.
Any critisms or suggestions are welcomed!

to start the program, unzip the files and run the 'Kexo The Bot' file above on any IDEs! 
Everything else should work as is.
